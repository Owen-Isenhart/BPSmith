## What are BPS Patches?

ROM Hacks work by creating a `bps` file by comparing the changes made between an original ROM with a modified ROM, and saving the differences. Then, the `bps` file can be applied to an original ROM to create the modified ROM from which it came from. This is done to allow the legal distribution of ROM hacks.

There are other file formats that can do this as well (`ips`, `ups`, etc.), but `bps` is often better due to:

* Supporting larger files
* Ensuring patch integrity with built-in checksums
* Creating smaller patches through delta encoding
